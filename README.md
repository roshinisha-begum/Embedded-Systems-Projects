# Embedded-Systems-Projects
This repository contains a collection of my embedded systems projects developed using the AT89C51 microcontroller with Keil ÂµVision and Proteus for simulation, as well as Arduino-based projects designed using Tinkercad and Arduino IDE. These projects showcase my hands-on experience in microcontroller programming, interfacing sensors
